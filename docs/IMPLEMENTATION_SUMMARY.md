# Cesium Ion Upload Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Cesium Ion upload feature has been fully implemented. Users can now upload 3D models, tilesets, and geospatial data directly to their own Cesium Ion accounts from the EnvisioXR editor by providing their personal access tokens.

## Changes Made

### 1. UI Component

**File**: `packages/ui/src/components/modals/tabs/UploadToIonTab.tsx`

- Added `accessToken` field to the upload form
- Token input is a required password field with helper text
- Updated validation to require the access token before upload
- Token is passed to the backend API for authentication

### 2. Backend API Route

**File**: `editor/app/api/ion-upload/route.ts` (NEW)

Created a new API endpoint with two methods:

- **POST**: Creates a new asset on Cesium Ion and returns upload credentials
  - Accepts user's access token in the request body
  - Authenticates with Cesium Ion using the user-provided token
  - Returns `assetId`, `uploadLocation` URL, and `onComplete` information

- **PUT**: Notifies Cesium Ion that the file upload is complete
  - Triggers asset processing on Cesium Ion

### 3. Frontend Implementation

**File**: `editor/app/components/AppBar/BuilderActions.tsx`

Updated the `handleUploadToIon` function with the actual implementation:

1. Accepts `accessToken` parameter from the UI
2. Calls backend API to create asset and get upload URL, passing the user's token
3. Uploads file directly to Cesium Ion's S3 bucket using PUT request
4. Tracks upload progress (0-100%)
5. Notifies Cesium Ion when upload is complete
6. Returns the asset ID for use in the application

### 4. Documentation

**File**: `docs/CESIUM_ION_UPLOAD.md` (NEW)

Comprehensive documentation including:

- Configuration instructions
- How to obtain a Cesium Ion access token
- Usage guide for end users
- API reference
- Troubleshooting guide

## Setup Required

**No server-side configuration needed!**

Each user provides their own Cesium Ion access token when uploading:

1. Users create a free account at https://ion.cesium.com/
2. Generate a personal access token at https://ion.cesium.com/tokens
3. Token requires `assets:write` scope
4. Enter the token in the upload form when uploading assets

This approach allows each user to upload to their own Cesium Ion account without any shared credentials.

## Technical Details

### Upload Flow

```
1. User selects file in UI
   ↓
2. Frontend → Backend API (/api/ion-upload POST)
   ↓
3. Backend → Cesium Ion API (create asset)
   ↓
4. Cesium Ion → Backend (upload credentials)
   ↓
5. Backend → Frontend (upload URL)
   ↓
6. Frontend → Cesium Ion S3 (PUT file)
   ↓
7. Frontend → Backend API (/api/ion-upload PUT)
   ↓
8. Backend → Cesium Ion (notify complete)
   ↓
9. Cesium Ion processes asset
```

### Security

- Each user provides their own access token (uploads to their own Ion account)
- Tokens are sent through backend API but never stored or logged
- User authentication required for all API endpoints
- File upload happens directly from client to Cesium Ion S3
- Users can revoke their tokens at any time from Ion dashboard

### Progress Tracking

- 0-10%: Initializing
- 10-20%: Creating asset on Cesium Ion
- 20-90%: Uploading file (real-time progress)
- 90-100%: Completing upload

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Create a Cesium Ion account at https://ion.cesium.com/ (if you don't have one)
2. Generate an access token with `assets:write` scope
3. Open the editor
4. Click Asset Manager → Upload to Ion tab
5. Select a file (.glb, .gltf, or .zip)
6. Fill in the required fields including your access token
7. Click "Upload to Ion"
8. Monitor the progress bar
9. Upon success, note the Asset ID returned
10. Verify the asset appears in your Ion account dashboard

## File Changes Summary

- **Created**: `editor/app/api/ion-upload/route.ts`
- **Modified**: `editor/app/components/AppBar/BuilderActions.tsx`
- **Modified**: `packages/ui/src/components/modals/tabs/UploadToIonTab.tsx`
- **Created**: `docs/CESIUM_ION_UPLOAD.md`
- **Created**: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

## Known Limitations

- File size limits depend on your Cesium Ion subscription tier
- Rate limiting applies based on Ion API quotas
- Large files require stable network connection
- Asset processing time varies based on file size and complexity

## Next Steps

1. Test with various file types and sizes
2. Consider adding asset status monitoring
3. Optionally implement automatic asset addition to scene after upload
4. Consider adding option to save frequently-used tokens locally (with user consent)
