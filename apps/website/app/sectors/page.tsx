          Delivered with PSMdt, Klorad reveals the lived state of corridors, junctions, and signaling systems. Traffic flow, maintenance windows, sensor outputs, and policy overlays become visible as one continuous environment. Operators can anticipate how a decision will propagate through the mobility network before it is enacted.

          The platform holds intent from early design through commissioning. Contractors, owners, and supervising authorities see how the site is evolving relative to specification, how temporary works affect logistics, and what must be resolved before hand-off. Nothing is abstracted into slides; the environment itself is what becomes knowable.

          These environments require a disciplined balance between access and preservation. Klorad lets custodians examine the interplay between visitor movement, climate, and conservation thresholds so that every intervention respects the integrity of the site while keeping interpretation grounded in evidence.
